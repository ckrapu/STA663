Project outline

For my final project, I plan to implement the hierarchical model based on the nested Chinese Restaurant Process (nCRP) described in the Blei et al paper. In summary, this work describes the creation of hierarchies of topics which contain mixtures of words/topics from the next level down and expresses this as a subtree of a much larger (potentially infinitely sized) potential tree. While the authors limited their analysis to hierarchies of a fixed size and length, they acknowledge that it is possible to remove this requirement. Moreover, their implementation defines a document as a path through the hierarchical tree passing each node once, but they also state that it is possible to express documents as mixtures of different paths. I plan to apply this to a data set of publicly-released emails from Florida governor Jeb Bush to uncover major elements and topics in his work-related email exchanges.
