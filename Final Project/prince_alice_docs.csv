,the,duke,valentino,had,returned,from,lombardy,where,he,had,been,to,clear,himself,with,the,king,of,france,from,the,calumnies,which,had,been,raised,against,him,by,the,florentines,concerning,the,rebellion,of,arezzo,and,other,towns,in,the,val,di,chiana,and,had,arrived,at,imola,whence,he,intended,with,his,army,to,enter,upon,the,campaign,against,giovanni,bentivogli,the,tyrant,of,bologna,for,he,intended,to,bring,that,city,under,his,domination,and,to,make,it,the,head,of,his,romagnian,duchy
these,matters,coming,to,the,knowledge,of,the,vitelli,and,orsini,and,their,following,it,appeared,to,them,that,the,duke,would,become,too,powerful,and,it,was,feared,that,having,seized,bologna,he,would,seek,to,destroy,them,in,order,that,he,might,become,supreme,in,italy,upon,this,a,meeting,was,called,at,magione,in,the,district,of,perugia,to,which,came,the,cardinal,pagolo,and,the,duke,di,gravina,orsini,vitellozzo,vitelli,oliverotto,da,fermo,gianpagolo,baglioni,the,tyrant,of,perugia,and,messer,antonio,da,venafro,sent,by,pandolfo,petrucci,the,prince,of,siena,here,were,discussed,the,power,and,courage,of,the,duke,and,the,necessity,of,curbing,his,ambitions,which,might,otherwise,bring,danger,to,the,rest,of,being,ruined,and,they,decided,not,to,abandon,the,bentivogli,but,to,strive,to,win,over,the,florentines,and,they,send,their,men,to,one,place,and,another,promising,to,one,party,assistance,and,to,another,encouragement,to,unite,with,them,against,the,common,enemy,this,meeting,was,at,once,reported,throughout,all,italy,and,those,who,were,discontented,under,the,duke,among,whom,were,the,people,of,urbino,took,hope,of,effecting,a,revolution
thus,it,arose,that,mens,minds,being,thus,unsettled,it,was,decided,by,certain,men,of,urbino,to,seize,the,fortress,of,san,leo,which,was,held,for,the,duke,and,which,they,captured,by,the,following,means,the,castellan,was,fortifying,the,rock,and,causing,timber,to,be,taken,there,so,the,conspirators,watched,and,when,certain,beams,which,were,being,carried,to,the,rock,were,upon,the,bridge,so,that,it,was,prevented,from,being,drawn,up,by,those,inside,they,took,the,opportunity,of,leaping,upon,the,bridge,and,thence,into,the,fortress,upon,this,capture,being,effected,the,whole,state,rebelled,and,recalled,the,old,duke,being,encouraged,in,this,not,so,much,by,the,capture,of,the,fort,as,by,the,diet,at,magione,from,whom,they,expected,to,get,assistance
those,who,heard,of,the,rebellion,at,urbino,thought,they,would,not,lose,the,opportunity,and,at,once,assembled,their,men,so,as,to,take,any,town,should,any,remain,in,the,hands,of,the,duke,in,that,state,and,they,sent,again,to,florence,to,beg,that,republic,to,join,with,them,in,destroying,the,common,firebrand,showing,that,the,risk,was,lessened,and,that,they,ought,not,to,wait,for,another,opportunity
but,the,florentines,from,hatred,for,sundry,reasons,of,the,vitelli,and,orsini,not,only,would,not,ally,themselves,but,sent,nicolo,machiavelli,their,secretary,to,offer,shelter,and,assistance,to,the,duke,against,his,enemies,the,duke,was,found,full,of,fear,at,imola,because,against,everybodys,expectation,his,soldiers,had,at,once,gone,over,to,the,enemy,and,he,found,himself,disarmed,and,war,at,his,door,but,recovering,courage,from,the,offers,of,the,florentines,he,decided,to,temporize,before,fighting,with,the,few,soldiers,that,remained,to,him,and,to,negotiate,for,a,reconciliation,and,also,to,get,assistance,this,latter,he,obtained,in,two,ways,by,sending,to,the,king,of,france,for,men,and,by,enlisting,menatarms,and,others,whom,he,turned,into,cavalry,of,a,sort,to,all,he,gave,money

and,the,duke,succeeded,so,well,in,this,that,they,sent,signor,pagolo,to,him,to,negotiate,for,a,reconciliation,and,they,brought,their,army,to,a,standstill,but,the,duke,did,not,stop,his,preparations,and,took,every,care,to,provide,himself,with,cavalry,and,infantry,and,that,such,preparations,might,not,be,apparent,to,the,others,he,sent,his,troops,in,separate,parties,to,every,part,of,the,romagna,in,the,meanwhile,there,came,also,to,him,five,hundred,french,lancers,and,although,he,found,himself,sufficiently,strong,to,take,vengeance,on,his,enemies,in,open,war,he,considered,that,it,would,be,safer,and,more,advantageous,to,outwit,them,and,for,this,reason,he,did,not,stop,the,work,of,reconciliation

a,barrowful,of,what,thought,alice,but,she,had,not,long,to,doubt,for,the,next,moment,a,shower,of,little,pebbles,came,rattling,in,at,the,window,and,some,of,them,hit,her,in,the,face,ill,put,a,stop,to,this,she,said,to,herself,and,shouted,out,youd,better,not,do,that,again,which,produced,another,dead,silence
alice,noticed,with,some,surprise,that,the,pebbles,were,all,turning,into,little,cakes,as,they,lay,on,the,floor,and,a,bright,idea,came,into,her,head,if,i,eat,one,of,these,cakes,she,thought,its,sure,to,make,some,change,in,my,size,and,as,it,cant,possibly,make,me,larger,it,must,make,me,smaller,i,suppose
so,she,swallowed,one,of,the,cakes,and,was,delighted,to,find,that,she,began,shrinking,directly,as,soon,as,she,was,small,enough,to,get,through,the,door,she,ran,out,of,the,house,and,found,quite,a,crowd,of,little,animals,and,birds,waiting,outside,the,poor,little,lizard,bill,was,in,the,middle,being,held,up,by,two,guineapigs,who,were,giving,it,something,out,of,a,bottle,they,all,made,a,rush,at,alice,the,moment,she,appeared,but,she,ran,off,as,hard,as,she,could,and,soon,found,herself,safe,in,a,thick,wood
the,first,thing,ive,got,to,do,said,alice,to,herself,as,she,wandered,about,in,the,wood,is,to,grow,to,my,right,size,again,and,the,second,thing,is,to,find,my,way,into,that,lovely,garden,i,think,that,will,be,the,best,plan
it,sounded,an,excellent,plan,no,doubt,and,very,neatly,and,simply,arranged,the,only,difficulty,was,that,she,had,not,the,smallest,idea,how,to,set,about,it,and,while,she,was,peering,about,anxiously,among,the,trees,a,little,sharp,bark,just,over,her,head,made,her,look,up,in,a,great,hurry
an,enormous,puppy,was,looking,down,at,her,with,large,round,eyes,and,feebly,stretching,out,one,paw,trying,to,touch,her,poor,little,thing,said,alice,in,a,coaxing,tone,and,she,tried,hard,to,whistle,to,it,but,she,was,terribly,frightened,all,the,time,at,the,thought,that,it,might,be,hungry,in,which,case,it,would,be,very,likely,to,eat,her,up,in,spite,of,all,her,coaxing
hardly,knowing,what,she,did,she,picked,up,a,little,bit,of,stick,and,held,it,out,to,the,puppy,whereupon,the,puppy,jumped,into,the,air,off,all,its,feet,at,once,with,a,yelp,of,delight,and,rushed,at,the,stick,and,made,believe,to,worry,it,then,alice,dodged,behind,a,great,thistle,to,keep,herself,from,being,run,over,and,the,moment,she,appeared,on,the,other,side,the,puppy,made,another,rush,at,the,stick,and,tumbled,head,over,heels,in,its,hurry,to,get,hold,of,it,then,alice,thinking,it,was,very,like,having,a,game,of,play,with,a,carthorse,and,expecting,every,moment,to,be,trampled,under,its,feet,ran,round,the,thistle,again,then,the,puppy,began,a,series,of,short,charges,at,the,stick,running,a,very,little,way,forwards,each,time,and,a,long,way,back,and,barking,hoarsely,all,the,while,till,at,last,it,sat,down,a,good,way,off,panting,with,its,tongue,hanging,out,of,its,mouth,and,its,great,eyes,half,shut
this,seemed,to,alice,a,good,opportunity,for,making,her,escape,so,she,set,off,at,once,and,ran,till,she,was,quite,tired,and,out,of,breath,and,till,the,puppys,bark,sounded,quite,faint,in,the,distance
and,yet,what,a,dear,little,puppy,it,was,said,alice,as,she,leant,against,a,buttercup,to,rest,herself,and,fanned,herself,with,one,of,the,leaves,i,should,have,liked,teaching,it,tricks,very,much,ifif,id,only,been,the,right,size,to,do,it,oh,dear,id,nearly,forgotten,that,ive,got,to,grow,up,again,let,me,seehow,is,it,to,be,managed,i,suppose,i,ought,to,eat,or,drink,something,or,other,but,the,great,question,is,what
the,great,question,certainly,was,what,alice,looked,all,round,her,at,the,flowers,and,the,blades,of,grass,but,she,did,not,see,anything,that,looked,like,the,right,thing,to,eat,or,drink,under,the,circumstances,there,was,a,large,mushroom,growing,near,her,about,the,same,height,as,herself,and,when,she,had,looked,under,it,and,on,both,sides,of,it,and,behind,it,it,occurred,to,her,that,she,might,as,well,look,and,see,what,was,on,the,top,of,it
she,stretched,herself,up,on,tiptoe,and,peeped,over,the,edge,of,the,mushroom,and,her,eyes,immediately,met,those,of,a,large,caterpillar,that,was,sitting,on,the,top,with,its,arms,folded,quietly,smoking,a,long,hookah,and,taking,not,the,smallest,notice,of,her,or,of,anything,else

alice,laughed,so,much,at,this,that,she,had,to,run,back,into,the,wood,for,fear,of,their,hearing,her,and,when,she,next,peeped,out,the,fishfootman,was,gone,and,the,other,was,sitting,on,the,ground,near,the,door,staring,stupidly,up,into,the,sky
alice,went,timidly,up,to,the,door,and,knocked
theres,no,sort,of,use,in,knocking,said,the,footman,and,that,for,two,reasons,first,because,im,on,the,same,side,of,the,door,as,you,are,secondly,because,theyre,making,such,a,noise,inside,no,one,could,possibly,hear,you,and,certainly,there,was,a,most,extraordinary,noise,going,on,withina,constant,howling,and,sneezing,and,every,now,and,then,a,great,crash,as,if,a,dish,or,kettle,had,been,broken,to,pieces
please,then,said,alice,how,am,i,to,get,in
there,might,be,some,sense,in,your,knocking,the,footman,went,on,without,attending,to,her,if,we,had,the,door,between,us,for,instance,if,you,were,inside,you,might,knock,and,i,could,let,you,out,you,know,he,was,looking,up,into,the,sky,all,the,time,he,was,speaking,and,this,alice,thought,decidedly,uncivil,but,perhaps,he,cant,help,it,she,said,to,herself,his,eyes,are,so,very,nearly,at,the,top,of,his,head,but,at,any,rate,he,might,answer,questionshow,am,i,to,get,in,she,repeated,aloud
i,shall,sit,here,the,footman,remarked,till,tomorrow
at,this,moment,the,door,of,the,house,opened,and,a,large,plate,came,skimming,out,straight,at,the,footmans,head,it,just,grazed,his,nose,and,broke,to,pieces,against,one,of,the,trees,behind,him
or,next,day,maybe,the,footman,continued,in,the,same,tone,exactly,as,if,nothing,had,happened
how,am,i,to,get,in,asked,alice,again,in,a,louder,tone

the,footman,seemed,to,think,this,a,good,opportunity,for,repeating,his,remark,with,variations,i,shall,sit,here,he,said,on,and,off,for,days,and,days
but,what,am,i,to,do,said,alice

theres,certainly,too,much,pepper,in,that,soup,alice,said,to,herself,as,well,as,she,could,for,sneezing
there,was,certainly,too,much,of,it,in,the,air,even,the,duchess,sneezed,occasionally,and,as,for,the,baby,it,was,sneezing,and,howling,alternately,without,a,moments,pause,the,only,things,in,the,kitchen,that,did,not,sneeze,were,the,cook,and,a,large,cat,which,was,sitting,on,the,hearth,and,grinning,from,ear,to,ear

alice,caught,the,baby,with,some,difficulty,as,it,was,a,queershaped,little,creature,and,held,out,its,arms,and,legs,in,all,directions,just,like,a,starfish,thought,alice,the,poor,little,thing,was,snorting,like,a,steamengine,when,she,caught,it,and,kept,doubling,itself,up,and,straightening,itself,out,again,so,that,altogether,for,the,first,minute,or,two,it,was,as,much,as,she,could,do,to,hold,it
as,soon,as,she,had,made,out,the,proper,way,of,nursing,it,which,was,to,twist,it,up,into,a,sort,of,knot,and,then,keep,tight,hold,of,its,right,ear,and,left,foot,so,as,to,prevent,its,undoing,itself,she,carried,it,out,into,the,open,air,if,i,dont,take,this,child,away,with,me,thought,alice,theyre,sure,to,kill,it,in,a,day,or,two,wouldnt,it,be,murder,to,leave,it,behind,she,said,the,last,words,out,loud,and,the,little,thing,grunted,in,reply,it,had,left,off,sneezing,by,this,time,dont,grunt,said,alice,thats,not,at,all,a,proper,way,of,expressing,yourself

the,chief,difficulty,alice,found,at,first,was,in,managing,her,flamingo,she,succeeded,in,getting,its,body,tucked,away,comfortably,enough,under,her,arm,with,its,legs,hanging,down,but,generally,just,as,she,had,got,its,neck,nicely,straightened,out,and,was,going,to,give,the,hedgehog,a,blow,with,its,head,it,would,twist,itself,round,and,look,up,in,her,face,with,such,a,puzzled,expression,that,she,could,not,help,bursting,out,laughing,and,when,she,had,got,its,head,down,and,was,going,to,begin,again,it,was,very,provoking,to,find,that,the,hedgehog,had,unrolled,itself,and,was,in,the,act,of,crawling,away,besides,all,this,there,was,generally,a,ridge,or,furrow,in,the,way,wherever,she,wanted,to,send,the,hedgehog,to,and,as,the,doubledup,soldiers,were,always,getting,up,and,walking,off,to,other,parts,of,the,ground,alice,soon,came,to,the,conclusion,that,it,was,a,very,difficult,game,indeed
the,players,all,played,at,once,without,waiting,for,turns,quarrelling,all,the,while,and,fighting,for,the,hedgehogs,and,in,a,very,short,time,the,queen,was,in,a,furious,passion,and,went,stamping,about,and,shouting,off,with,his,head,or,off,with,her,head,about,once,in,a,minute
alice,began,to,feel,very,uneasy,to,be,sure,she,had,not,as,yet,had,any,dispute,with,the,queen,but,she,knew,that,it,might,happen,any,minute,and,then,thought,she,what,would,become,of,me,theyre,dreadfully,fond,of,beheading,people,here,the,great,wonder,is,that,theres,any,one,left,alive
she,was,looking,about,for,some,way,of,escape,and,wondering,whether,she,could,get,away,without,being,seen,when,she,noticed,a,curious,appearance,in,the,air,it,puzzled,her,very,much,at,first,but,after,watching,it,a,minute,or,two,she,made,it,out,to,be,a,grin,and,she,said,to,herself,its,the,cheshire,cat,now,i,shall,have,somebody,to,talk,to
how,are,you,getting,on,said,the,cat,as,soon,as,there,was,mouth,enough,for,it,to,speak,with
alice,waited,till,the,eyes,appeared,and,then,nodded,its,no,use,speaking,to,it,she,thought,till,its,ears,have,come,or,at,least,one,of,them,in,another,minute,the,whole,head,appeared,and,then,alice,put,down,her,flamingo,and,began,an,account,of,the,game,feeling,very,glad,she,had,someone,to,listen,to,her,the,cat,seemed,to,think,that,there,was,enough,of,it,now,in,sight,and,no,more,of,it,appeared
i,dont,think,they,play,at,all,fairly,alice,began,in,rather,a,complaining,tone,and,they,all,quarrel,so,dreadfully,one,cant,hear,oneself,speakand,they,dont,seem,to,have,any,rules,in,particular,at,least,if,there,are,nobody,attends,to,themand,youve,no,idea,how,confusing,it,is,all,the,things,being,alive,for,instance,theres,the,arch,ive,got,to,go,through,next,walking,about,at,the,other,end,of,the,groundand,i,should,have,croqueted,the,queens,hedgehog,just,now,only,it,ran,away,when,it,saw,mine,coming
how,do,you,like,the,queen,said,the,cat,in,a,low,voice
not,at,all,said,alice,shes,so,extremely,just,then,she,noticed,that,the,queen,was,close,behind,her,listening,so,she,went,on,likely,to,win,that,its,hardly,worth,while,finishing,the,game
the,queen,smiled,and,passed,on
who,are,you,talking,to,said,the,king,going,up,to,alice,and,looking,at,the,cats,head,with,great,curiosity
its,a,friend,of,minea,cheshire,cat,said,alice,allow,me,to,introduce,it

the,queen,had,only,one,way,of,settling,all,difficulties,great,or,small,off,with,his,head,she,said,without,even,looking,round
ill,fetch,the,executioner,myself,said,the,king,eagerly,and,he,hurried,off
alice,thought,she,might,as,well,go,back,and,see,how,the,game,was,going,on,as,she,heard,the,queens,voice,in,the,distance,screaming,with,passion,she,had,already,heard,her,sentence,three,of,the,players,to,be,executed,for,having,missed,their,turns,and,she,did,not,like,the,look,of,things,at,all,as,the,game,was,in,such,confusion,that,she,never,knew,whether,it,was,her,turn,or,not,so,she,went,in,search,of,her,hedgehog
the,hedgehog,was,engaged,in,a,fight,with,another,hedgehog,which,seemed,to,alice,an,excellent,opportunity,for,croqueting,one,of,them,with,the,other,the,only,difficulty,was,that,her,flamingo,was,gone,across,to,the,other,side,of,the,garden,where,alice,could,see,it,trying,in,a,helpless,sort,of,way,to,fly,up,into,a,tree
by,the,time,she,had,caught,the,flamingo,and,brought,it,back,the,fight,was,over,and,both,the,hedgehogs,were,out,of,sight,but,it,doesnt,matter,much,thought,alice,as,all,the,arches,are,gone,from,this,side,of,the,ground,so,she,tucked,it,away,under,her,arm,that,it,might,not,escape,again,and,went,back,for,a,little,more,conversation,with,her,friend
when,she,got,back,to,the,cheshire,cat,she,was,surprised,to,find,quite,a,large,crowd,collected,round,it,there,was,a,dispute,going,on,between,the,executioner,the,king,and,the,queen,who,were,all,talking,at,once,while,all,the,rest,were,quite,silent,and,looked,very,uncomfortable
the,moment,alice,appeared,she,was,appealed,to,by,all,three,to,settle,the,question,and,they,repeated,their,arguments,to,her,though,as,they,all,spoke,at,once,she,found,it,very,hard,indeed,to,make,out,exactly,what,they,said
the,executioners,argument,was,that,you,couldnt,cut,off,a,head,unless,there,was,a,body,to,cut,it,off,from,that,he,had,never,had,to,do,such,a,thing,before,and,he,wasnt,going,to,begin,at,his,time,of,life
the,kings,argument,was,that,anything,that,had,a,head,could,be,beheaded,and,that,you,werent,to,talk,nonsense
the,queens,argument,was,that,if,something,wasnt,done,about,it,in,less,than,no,time,shed,have,everybody,executed,all,round,it,was,this,last,remark,that,had,made,the,whole,party,look,so,grave,and,anxious
alice,could,think,of,nothing,else,to,say,but,it,belongs,to,the,duchess,youd,better,ask,her,about,it
shes,in,prison,the,queen,said,to,the,executioner,fetch,her,here,and,the,executioner,went,off,like,an,arrow
,the,cats,head,began,fading,away,the,moment,he,was,gone,and,by,the,time,he,had,come,back,with,the,duchess,it,had,entirely,disappeared,so,the,king,and,the,executioner,ran,wildly,up,and,down,looking,for,it,while,the,rest,of,the,party,went,back,to,the,game
