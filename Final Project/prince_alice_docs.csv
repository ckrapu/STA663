,the,duke,valentino,had,returned,from,lombardy,where,he,had,been,to,clear,himself,with,the,king,of,france,from,the,calumnies,which,had,been,raised,against,him,by,the,florentines,concerning,the,rebellion,of,arezzo,and,other,towns,in,the,val,di,chiana,and,had,arrived,at,imola,whence,he,intended,with,his,army,to,enter,upon,the,campaign,against,giovanni,bentivogli,the,tyrant,of,bologna,for,he,intended,to,bring,that,city,under,his,domination,and,to,make,it,the,head,of,his,romagnian,duchy
these,matters,coming,to,the,knowledge,of,the,vitelli,and,orsini,and,their,following,it,appeared,to,them,that,the,duke,would,become,too,powerful,and,it,was,feared,that,having,seized,bologna,he,would,seek,to,destroy,them,in,order,that,he,might,become,supreme,in,italy,upon,this,a,meeting,was,called,at,magione,in,the,district,of,perugia,to,which,came,the,cardinal,pagolo,and,the,duke,di,gravina,orsini,vitellozzo,vitelli,oliverotto,da,fermo,gianpagolo,baglioni,the,tyrant,of,perugia,and,messer,antonio,da,venafro,sent,by,pandolfo,petrucci,the,prince,of,siena,here,were,discussed,the,power,and,courage,of,the,duke,and,the,necessity,of,curbing,his,ambitions,which,might,otherwise,bring,danger,to,the,rest,of,being,ruined,and,they,decided,not,to,abandon,the,bentivogli,but,to,strive,to,win,over,the,florentines,and,they,send,their,men,to,one,place,and,another,promising,to,one,party,assistance,and,to,another,encouragement,to,unite,with,them,against,the,common,enemy,this,meeting,was,at,once,reported,throughout,all,italy,and,those,who,were,discontented,under,the,duke,among,whom,were,the,people,of,urbino,took,hope,of,effecting,a,revolution
thus,it,arose,that,mens,minds,being,thus,unsettled,it,was,decided,by,certain,men,of,urbino,to,seize,the,fortress,of,san,leo,which,was,held,for,the,duke,and,which,they,captured,by,the,following,means,the,castellan,was,fortifying,the,rock,and,causing,timber,to,be,taken,there,so,the,conspirators,watched,and,when,certain,beams,which,were,being,carried,to,the,rock,were,upon,the,bridge,so,that,it,was,prevented,from,being,drawn,up,by,those,inside,they,took,the,opportunity,of,leaping,upon,the,bridge,and,thence,into,the,fortress,upon,this,capture,being,effected,the,whole,state,rebelled,and,recalled,the,old,duke,being,encouraged,in,this,not,so,much,by,the,capture,of,the,fort,as,by,the,diet,at,magione,from,whom,they,expected,to,get,assistance
those,who,heard,of,the,rebellion,at,urbino,thought,they,would,not,lose,the,opportunity,and,at,once,assembled,their,men,so,as,to,take,any,town,should,any,remain,in,the,hands,of,the,duke,in,that,state,and,they,sent,again,to,florence,to,beg,that,republic,to,join,with,them,in,destroying,the,common,firebrand,showing,that,the,risk,was,lessened,and,that,they,ought,not,to,wait,for,another,opportunity
but,the,florentines,from,hatred,for,sundry,reasons,of,the,vitelli,and,orsini,not,only,would,not,ally,themselves,but,sent,nicolo,machiavelli,their,secretary,to,offer,shelter,and,assistance,to,the,duke,against,his,enemies,the,duke,was,found,full,of,fear,at,imola,because,against,everybodys,expectation,his,soldiers,had,at,once,gone,over,to,the,enemy,and,he,found,himself,disarmed,and,war,at,his,door,but,recovering,courage,from,the,offers,of,the,florentines,he,decided,to,temporize,before,fighting,with,the,few,soldiers,that,remained,to,him,and,to,negotiate,for,a,reconciliation,and,also,to,get,assistance,this,latter,he,obtained,in,two,ways,by,sending,to,the,king,of,france,for,men,and,by,enlisting,menatarms,and,others,whom,he,turned,into,cavalry,of,a,sort,to,all,he,gave,money

and,the,duke,succeeded,so,well,in,this,that,they,sent,signor,pagolo,to,him,to,negotiate,for,a,reconciliation,and,they,brought,their,army,to,a,standstill,but,the,duke,did,not,stop,his,preparations,and,took,every,care,to,provide,himself,with,cavalry,and,infantry,and,that,such,preparations,might,not,be,apparent,to,the,others,he,sent,his,troops,in,separate,parties,to,every,part,of,the,romagna,in,the,meanwhile,there,came,also,to,him,five,hundred,french,lancers,and,although,he,found,himself,sufficiently,strong,to,take,vengeance,on,his,enemies,in,open,war,he,considered,that,it,would,be,safer,and,more,advantageous,to,outwit,them,and,for,this,reason,he,did,not,stop,the,work,of,reconciliation

a,barrowful,of,what,thought,alice,but,she,had,not,long,to,doubt,for,the,next,moment,a,shower,of,little,pebbles,came,rattling,in,at,the,window,and,some,of,them,hit,her,in,the,face,ill,put,a,stop,to,this,she,said,to,herself,and,shouted,out,youd,better,not,do,that,again,which,produced,another,dead,silence
alice,noticed,with,some,surprise,that,the,pebbles,were,all,turning,into,little,cakes,as,they,lay,on,the,floor,and,a,bright,idea,came,into,her,head,if,i,eat,one,of,these,cakes,she,thought,its,sure,to,make,some,change,in,my,size,and,as,it,cant,possibly,make,me,larger,it,must,make,me,smaller,i,suppose
so,she,swallowed,one,of,the,cakes,and,was,delighted,to,find,that,she,began,shrinking,directly,as,soon,as,she,was,small,enough,to,get,through,the,door,she,ran,out,of,the,house,and,found,quite,a,crowd,of,little,animals,and,birds,waiting,outside,the,poor,little,lizard,bill,was,in,the,middle,being,held,up,by,two,guineapigs,who,were,giving,it,something,out,of,a,bottle,they,all,made,a,rush,at,alice,the,moment,she,appeared,but,she,ran,off,as,hard,as,she,could,and,soon,found,herself,safe,in,a,thick,wood
the,first,thing,ive,got,to,do,said,alice,to,herself,as,she,wandered,about,in,the,wood,is,to,grow,to,my,right,size,again,and,the,second,thing,is,to,find,my,way,into,that,lovely,garden,i,think,that,will,be,the,best,plan
it,sounded,an,excellent,plan,no,doubt,and,very,neatly,and,simply,arranged,the,only,difficulty,was,that,she,had,not,the,smallest,idea,how,to,set,about,it,and,while,she,was,peering,about,anxiously,among,the,trees,a,little,sharp,bark,just,over,her,head,made,her,look,up,in,a,great,hurry
an,enormous,puppy,was,looking,down,at,her,with,large,round,eyes,and,feebly,stretching,out,one,paw,trying,to,touch,her,poor,little,thing,said,alice,in,a,coaxing,tone,and,she,tried,hard,to,whistle,to,it,but,she,was,terribly,frightened,all,the,time,at,the,thought,that,it,might,be,hungry,in,which,case,it,would,be,very,likely,to,eat,her,up,in,spite,of,all,her,coaxing
hardly,knowing,what,she,did,she,picked,up,a,little,bit,of,stick,and,held,it,out,to,the,puppy,whereupon,the,puppy,jumped,into,the,air,off,all,its,feet,at,once,with,a,yelp,of,delight,and,rushed,at,the,stick,and,made,believe,to,worry,it,then,alice,dodged,behind,a,great,thistle,to,keep,herself,from,being,run,over,and,the,moment,she,appeared,on,the,other,side,the,puppy,made,another,rush,at,the,stick,and,tumbled,head,over,heels,in,its,hurry,to,get,hold,of,it,then,alice,thinking,it,was,very,like,having,a,game,of,play,with,a,carthorse,and,expecting,every,moment,to,be,trampled,under,its,feet,ran,round,the,thistle,again,then,the,puppy,began,a,series,of,short,charges,at,the,stick,running,a,very,little,way,forwards,each,time,and,a,long,way,back,and,barking,hoarsely,all,the,while,till,at,last,it,sat,down,a,good,way,off,panting,with,its,tongue,hanging,out,of,its,mouth,and,its,great,eyes,half,shut
this,seemed,to,alice,a,good,opportunity,for,making,her,escape,so,she,set,off,at,once,and,ran,till,she,was,quite,tired,and,out,of,breath,and,till,the,puppys,bark,sounded,quite,faint,in,the,distance
and,yet,what,a,dear,little,puppy,it,was,said,alice,as,she,leant,against,a,buttercup,to,rest,herself,and,fanned,herself,with,one,of,the,leaves,i,should,have,liked,teaching,it,tricks,very,much,ifif,id,only,been,the,right,size,to,do,it,oh,dear,id,nearly,forgotten,that,ive,got,to,grow,up,again,let,me,seehow,is,it,to,be,managed,i,suppose,i,ought,to,eat,or,drink,something,or,other,but,the,great,question,is,what
the,great,question,certainly,was,what,alice,looked,all,round,her,at,the,flowers,and,the,blades,of,grass,but,she,did,not,see,anything,that,looked,like,the,right,thing,to,eat,or,drink,under,the,circumstances,there,was,a,large,mushroom,growing,near,her,about,the,same,height,as,herself,and,when,she,had,looked,under,it,and,on,both,sides,of,it,and,behind,it,it,occurred,to,her,that,she,might,as,well,look,and,see,what,was,on,the,top,of,it
she,stretched,herself,up,on,tiptoe,and,peeped,over,the,edge,of,the,mushroom,and,her,eyes,immediately,met,those,of,a,large,caterpillar,that,was,sitting,on,the,top,with,its,arms,folded,quietly,smoking,a,long,hookah,and,taking,not,the,smallest,notice,of,her,or,of,anything,else

alice,laughed,so,much,at,this,that,she,had,to,run,back,into,the,wood,for,fear,of,their,hearing,her,and,when,she,next,peeped,out,the,fishfootman,was,gone,and,the,other,was,sitting,on,the,ground,near,the,door,staring,stupidly,up,into,the,sky
alice,went,timidly,up,to,the,door,and,knocked
theres,no,sort,of,use,in,knocking,said,the,footman,and,that,for,two,reasons,first,because,im,on,the,same,side,of,the,door,as,you,are,secondly,because,theyre,making,such,a,noise,inside,no,one,could,possibly,hear,you,and,certainly,there,was,a,most,extraordinary,noise,going,on,withina,constant,howling,and,sneezing,and,every,now,and,then,a,great,crash,as,if,a,dish,or,kettle,had,been,broken,to,pieces
please,then,said,alice,how,am,i,to,get,in
there,might,be,some,sense,in,your,knocking,the,footman,went,on,without,attending,to,her,if,we,had,the,door,between,us,for,instance,if,you,were,inside,you,might,knock,and,i,could,let,you,out,you,know,he,was,looking,up,into,the,sky,all,the,time,he,was,speaking,and,this,alice,thought,decidedly,uncivil,but,perhaps,he,cant,help,it,she,said,to,herself,his,eyes,are,so,very,nearly,at,the,top,of,his,head,but,at,any,rate,he,might,answer,questionshow,am,i,to,get,in,she,repeated,aloud
i,shall,sit,here,the,footman,remarked,till,tomorrow
at,this,moment,the,door,of,the,house,opened,and,a,large,plate,came,skimming,out,straight,at,the,footmans,head,it,just,grazed,his,nose,and,broke,to,pieces,against,one,of,the,trees,behind,him
or,next,day,maybe,the,footman,continued,in,the,same,tone,exactly,as,if,nothing,had,happened
how,am,i,to,get,in,asked,alice,again,in,a,louder,tone

the,footman,seemed,to,think,this,a,good,opportunity,for,repeating,his,remark,with,variations,i,shall,sit,here,he,said,on,and,off,for,days,and,days
but,what,am,i,to,do,said,alice

theres,certainly,too,much,pepper,in,that,soup,alice,said,to,herself,as,well,as,she,could,for,sneezing
there,was,certainly,too,much,of,it,in,the,air,even,the,duchess,sneezed,occasionally,and,as,for,the,baby,it,was,sneezing,and,howling,alternately,without,a,moments,pause,the,only,things,in,the,kitchen,that,did,not,sneeze,were,the,cook,and,a,large,cat,which,was,sitting,on,the,hearth,and,grinning,from,ear,to,ear

alice,caught,the,baby,with,some,difficulty,as,it,was,a,queershaped,little,creature,and,held,out,its,arms,and,legs,in,all,directions,just,like,a,starfish,thought,alice,the,poor,little,thing,was,snorting,like,a,steamengine,when,she,caught,it,and,kept,doubling,itself,up,and,straightening,itself,out,again,so,that,altogether,for,the,first,minute,or,two,it,was,as,much,as,she,could,do,to,hold,it
as,soon,as,she,had,made,out,the,proper,way,of,nursing,it,which,was,to,twist,it,up,into,a,sort,of,knot,and,then,keep,tight,hold,of,its,right,ear,and,left,foot,so,as,to,prevent,its,undoing,itself,she,carried,it,out,into,the,open,air,if,i,dont,take,this,child,away,with,me,thought,alice,theyre,sure,to,kill,it,in,a,day,or,two,wouldnt,it,be,murder,to,leave,it,behind,she,said,the,last,words,out,loud,and,the,little,thing,grunted,in,reply,it,had,left,off,sneezing,by,this,time,dont,grunt,said,alice,thats,not,at,all,a,proper,way,of,expressing,yourself

the,chief,difficulty,alice,found,at,first,was,in,managing,her,flamingo,she,succeeded,in,getting,its,body,tucked,away,comfortably,enough,under,her,arm,with,its,legs,hanging,down,but,generally,just,as,she,had,got,its,neck,nicely,straightened,out,and,was,going,to,give,the,hedgehog,a,blow,with,its,head,it,would,twist,itself,round,and,look,up,in,her,face,with,such,a,puzzled,expression,that,she,could,not,help,bursting,out,laughing,and,when,she,had,got,its,head,down,and,was,going,to,begin,again,it,was,very,provoking,to,find,that,the,hedgehog,had,unrolled,itself,and,was,in,the,act,of,crawling,away,besides,all,this,there,was,generally,a,ridge,or,furrow,in,the,way,wherever,she,wanted,to,send,the,hedgehog,to,and,as,the,doubledup,soldiers,were,always,getting,up,and,walking,off,to,other,parts,of,the,ground,alice,soon,came,to,the,conclusion,that,it,was,a,very,difficult,game,indeed
the,players,all,played,at,once,without,waiting,for,turns,quarrelling,all,the,while,and,fighting,for,the,hedgehogs,and,in,a,very,short,time,the,queen,was,in,a,furious,passion,and,went,stamping,about,and,shouting,off,with,his,head,or,off,with,her,head,about,once,in,a,minute
alice,began,to,feel,very,uneasy,to,be,sure,she,had,not,as,yet,had,any,dispute,with,the,queen,but,she,knew,that,it,might,happen,any,minute,and,then,thought,she,what,would,become,of,me,theyre,dreadfully,fond,of,beheading,people,here,the,great,wonder,is,that,theres,any,one,left,alive
she,was,looking,about,for,some,way,of,escape,and,wondering,whether,she,could,get,away,without,being,seen,when,she,noticed,a,curious,appearance,in,the,air,it,puzzled,her,very,much,at,first,but,after,watching,it,a,minute,or,two,she,made,it,out,to,be,a,grin,and,she,said,to,herself,its,the,cheshire,cat,now,i,shall,have,somebody,to,talk,to
how,are,you,getting,on,said,the,cat,as,soon,as,there,was,mouth,enough,for,it,to,speak,with
alice,waited,till,the,eyes,appeared,and,then,nodded,its,no,use,speaking,to,it,she,thought,till,its,ears,have,come,or,at,least,one,of,them,in,another,minute,the,whole,head,appeared,and,then,alice,put,down,her,flamingo,and,began,an,account,of,the,game,feeling,very,glad,she,had,someone,to,listen,to,her,the,cat,seemed,to,think,that,there,was,enough,of,it,now,in,sight,and,no,more,of,it,appeared
i,dont,think,they,play,at,all,fairly,alice,began,in,rather,a,complaining,tone,and,they,all,quarrel,so,dreadfully,one,cant,hear,oneself,speakand,they,dont,seem,to,have,any,rules,in,particular,at,least,if,there,are,nobody,attends,to,themand,youve,no,idea,how,confusing,it,is,all,the,things,being,alive,for,instance,theres,the,arch,ive,got,to,go,through,next,walking,about,at,the,other,end,of,the,groundand,i,should,have,croqueted,the,queens,hedgehog,just,now,only,it,ran,away,when,it,saw,mine,coming
how,do,you,like,the,queen,said,the,cat,in,a,low,voice
not,at,all,said,alice,shes,so,extremely,just,then,she,noticed,that,the,queen,was,close,behind,her,listening,so,she,went,on,likely,to,win,that,its,hardly,worth,while,finishing,the,game
the,queen,smiled,and,passed,on
who,are,you,talking,to,said,the,king,going,up,to,alice,and,looking,at,the,cats,head,with,great,curiosity
its,a,friend,of,minea,cheshire,cat,said,alice,allow,me,to,introduce,it

the,queen,had,only,one,way,of,settling,all,difficulties,great,or,small,off,with,his,head,she,said,without,even,looking,round
ill,fetch,the,executioner,myself,said,the,king,eagerly,and,he,hurried,off
alice,thought,she,might,as,well,go,back,and,see,how,the,game,was,going,on,as,she,heard,the,queens,voice,in,the,distance,screaming,with,passion,she,had,already,heard,her,sentence,three,of,the,players,to,be,executed,for,having,missed,their,turns,and,she,did,not,like,the,look,of,things,at,all,as,the,game,was,in,such,confusion,that,she,never,knew,whether,it,was,her,turn,or,not,so,she,went,in,search,of,her,hedgehog
the,hedgehog,was,engaged,in,a,fight,with,another,hedgehog,which,seemed,to,alice,an,excellent,opportunity,for,croqueting,one,of,them,with,the,other,the,only,difficulty,was,that,her,flamingo,was,gone,across,to,the,other,side,of,the,garden,where,alice,could,see,it,trying,in,a,helpless,sort,of,way,to,fly,up,into,a,tree
by,the,time,she,had,caught,the,flamingo,and,brought,it,back,the,fight,was,over,and,both,the,hedgehogs,were,out,of,sight,but,it,doesnt,matter,much,thought,alice,as,all,the,arches,are,gone,from,this,side,of,the,ground,so,she,tucked,it,away,under,her,arm,that,it,might,not,escape,again,and,went,back,for,a,little,more,conversation,with,her,friend
when,she,got,back,to,the,cheshire,cat,she,was,surprised,to,find,quite,a,large,crowd,collected,round,it,there,was,a,dispute,going,on,between,the,executioner,the,king,and,the,queen,who,were,all,talking,at,once,while,all,the,rest,were,quite,silent,and,looked,very,uncomfortable
the,moment,alice,appeared,she,was,appealed,to,by,all,three,to,settle,the,question,and,they,repeated,their,arguments,to,her,though,as,they,all,spoke,at,once,she,found,it,very,hard,indeed,to,make,out,exactly,what,they,said
the,executioners,argument,was,that,you,couldnt,cut,off,a,head,unless,there,was,a,body,to,cut,it,off,from,that,he,had,never,had,to,do,such,a,thing,before,and,he,wasnt,going,to,begin,at,his,time,of,life
the,kings,argument,was,that,anything,that,had,a,head,could,be,beheaded,and,that,you,werent,to,talk,nonsense
the,queens,argument,was,that,if,something,wasnt,done,about,it,in,less,than,no,time,shed,have,everybody,executed,all,round,it,was,this,last,remark,that,had,made,the,whole,party,look,so,grave,and,anxious
alice,could,think,of,nothing,else,to,say,but,it,belongs,to,the,duchess,youd,better,ask,her,about,it
shes,in,prison,the,queen,said,to,the,executioner,fetch,her,here,and,the,executioner,went,off,like,an,arrow
,the,cats,head,began,fading,away,the,moment,he,was,gone,and,by,the,time,he,had,come,back,with,the,duchess,it,had,entirely,disappeared,so,the,king,and,the,executioner,ran,wildly,up,and,down,looking,for,it,while,the,rest,of,the,party,went,back,to,the,game

dharma,is,obedience,to,the,command,of,the,shastra,or,holy,writ,of,the,hindoos,to,do,certain,things,such,as,the,performance,of,sacrifices,which,are,not,generally,done,because,they,do,not,belong,to,this,world,and,produce,no,visible,effect,and,not,to,do,other,things,such,as,eating,meat,which,is,often,done,because,it,belongs,to,this,world,and,has,visible,effects
dharma,should,be,learnt,from,the,shruti,holy,writ,and,from,those,conversant,with,it
artha,is,the,acquisition,of,arts,land,gold,cattle,wealth,equipages,and,friends,it,is,further,the,protection,of,what,is,acquired,and,the,increase,of,what,is,protected
artha,should,be,learnt,from,the,kings,officers,and,from,merchants,who,may,be,versed,in,the,ways,of,commerce
kama,is,the,enjoyment,of,appropriate,objects,by,the,five,senses,of,hearing,feeling,seeing,tasting,and,smelling,assisted,by,the,mind,together,with,the,soul,the,ingredient,in,this,is,a,peculiar,contact,between,the,organ,of,sense,and,its,object,and,the,consciousness,of,pleasure,which,arises,from,that,contact,is,called,kama
kama,is,to,be,learnt,from,the,kama,sutra,aphorisms,on,love,and,from,the,practice,of,citizens

some,learned,men,say,that,as,dharma,is,connected,with,things,not,belonging,to,this,world,it,is,appropriately,treated,of,in,a,book,and,so,also,is,artha,because,it,is,practised,only,by,the,application,of,proper,means,and,a,knowledge,of,those,means,can,only,be,obtained,by,study,and,from,books,but,kama,being,a,thing,which,is,practised,even,by,the,brute,creation,and,which,is,to,be,found,everywhere,does,not,want,any,work,on,the,subject
,answer
this,is,not,so,sexual,intercourse,being,a,thing,dependent,on,man,and,woman,requires,the,application,of,proper,means,by,them,and,those,means,are,to,be,learnt,from,the,kama,shastra,the,nonapplication,of,proper,means,which,we,see,in,the,brute,creation,is,caused,by,their,being,unrestrained,and,by,the,females,among,them,only,being,fit,for,sexual,intercourse,at,certain,seasons,and,no,more,and,by,their,intercourse,not,being,preceded,by,thought,of,any,kind
,objection,2
the,lokayatikas4,sayreligious,ordinances,should,not,be,observed,for,they,bear,a,future,fruit,and,at,the,same,time,it,is,also,doubtful,whether,they,will,bear,any,fruit,at,all,what,foolish,person,will,give,away,that,which,is,in,his,own,hands,into,the,hands,of,another,moreover,it,is,better,to,have,a,pigeon,today,than,a,peacock,tomorrow,and,a,copper,coin,which,we,have,the,certainty,of,obtaining,is,better,than,a,gold,coin,the,possession,of,which,is,doubtful

,answer
it,is,not,right,to,say,so,as,the,acquisition,of,every,object,presupposes,at,all,events,some,exertion,on,the,part,of,man,the,application,of,proper,means,may,be,said,to,be,the,cause,of,gaining,all,our,ends,and,this,application,of,proper,means,being,thus,necessary,even,where,a,thing,is,destined,to,happen,it,follows,that,a,person,who,does,nothing,will,enjoy,no,happiness
,objection,4
those,who,are,inclined,to,think,that,artha,is,the,chief,object,to,be,obtained,argue,thus,pleasures,should,not,be,sought,for,because,they,are,obstacles,to,the,practice,of,dharma,and,artha,which,are,both,superior,to,them,and,are,also,disliked,by,meritorious,persons,pleasures,also,bring,a,man,into,distress,and,into,contact,with,low,persons,they,cause,him,to,commit,unrighteous,deeds,and,produce,impurity,in,him,they,make,him,regardless,of,the,future,and,encourage,carelessness,and,levity,and,lastly,they,cause,him,to,be,disbelieved,by,all,received,by,none,and,despised,by,everybody,including,himself,it,is,notorious,moreover,that,many,men,who,have,given,themselves,up,to,pleasure,alone,have,been,ruined,along,with,their,families,and,relations,thus,king,dandakya7,of,the,bhoja,dynasty,carried,off,a,brahmans,daughter,with,evil,intent,and,was,eventually,ruined,and,lost,his,kingdom,indra,too,having,violated,the,chastity,of,ahalya8,was,made,to,suffer,for,it,in,a,like,manner,the,mighty,kichaka9,who,tried,to,seduce,draupadi,and,ravana10,who,attempted,to,gain,over,sita,were,punished,for,their,crimes,these,and,many,others,fell,by,reason,of,their,pleasures
,answer
this,objection,cannot,be,sustained,for,pleasures,being,as,necessary,for,the,existence,and,well,being,of,the,body,as,food,are,consequently,equally,required,they,are,moreover,the,results,of,dharma,and,artha,pleasures,are,therefore,to,be,followed,with,moderation,and,caution,no,one,refrains,from,cooking,food,because,there,are,beggars,to,ask,for,it,or,from,sowing,seed,because,there,are,deer,to,destroy,the,corn,when,it,is,grown,up
thus,a,man,practising,dharma,artha,and,kama,enjoys,happiness,both,in,this,world,and,in,the,world,to,come,the,good,perform,those,actions,in,which,there,is,no,fear,as,to,what,is,to,result,from,them,in,the,next,world,and,in,which,there,is,no,danger,to,their,welfare,any,action,which,conduces,to,the,practice,of,dharma,artha,and,kama,together,or,of,any,two,or,even,one,of,them,should,be,performed,but,an,action,which,conduces,to,the,practice,of,one,of,them,at,the,expense,of,the,remaining,two,should,not,be,performed

woman,also,according,to,the,depth,of,her,yoni,is,either,a,female,deer,a,mare,or,a,female,elephant
there,are,thus,three,equal,unions,between,persons,of,corresponding,dimensions,and,there,are,six,unequal,unions,when,the,dimensions,do,not,correspond,or,nine,in,all,as,the,following,table,shows

a,man,is,called,a,man,of,small,passion,whose,desire,at,the,time,of,sexual,union,is,not,great,whose,semen,is,scanty,and,who,cannot,bear,the,warm,embraces,of,the,female
those,who,differ,from,this,temperament,are,called,men,of,middling,passion,while,those,of,intense,passion,are,full,of,desire
in,the,same,way,women,are,supposed,to,have,the,three,degrees,of,feeling,as,specified,above
lastly,according,to,time,there,are,three,kinds,of,men,and,women,viz,the,shorttimed,the,moderatetimed,and,the,longtimed,and,of,these,as,in,the,previous,statements,there,are,nine,kinds,of,union
but,on,this,last,head,there,is,a,difference,of,opinion,about,the,female,which,should,be,stated
auddalika,says,females,do,not,emit,as,males,do,the,males,simply,remove,their,desire,while,the,females,from,their,consciousness,of,desire,feel,a,certain,kind,of,pleasure,which,gives,them,satisfaction,but,it,is,impossible,for,them,to,tell,you,what,kind,of,pleasure,they,feel,the,fact,from,which,this,becomes,evident,is,that,males,when,engaged,in,coition,cease,of,themselves,after,emission,and,are,satisfied,but,it,is,not,so,with,females
this,opinion,is,however,objected,to,on,the,grounds,that,if,a,male,be,a,longtimed,the,female,loves,him,the,more,but,if,he,be,shorttimed,she,is,dissatisfied,with,him,and,this,circumstance,some,say,would,prove,that,the,female,emits,also
but,this,opinion,does,not,hold,good,for,if,it,takes,a,long,time,to,allay,a,womans,desire,and,during,this,time,she,is,enjoying,great,pleasure,it,is,quite,natural,then,that,she,should,wish,for,its,continuation,and,on,this,subject,there,is,a,verse,as,follows
by,union,with,men,the,lust,desire,or,passion,of,women,is,satisfied,and,the,pleasure,derived,from,the,consciousness,of,it,is,called,their,satisfaction
the,followers,of,babhravya,however,say,that,the,semen,of,women,continues,to,fall,from,the,beginning,of,the,sexual,union,to,its,end,and,it,is,right,that,it,should,be,so,for,if,they,had,no,semen,there,would,be,no,embryo
to,this,there,is,an,objection,in,the,beginning,of,coition,the,passion,of,the,woman,is,middling,and,she,cannot,bear,the,vigorous,thrusts,of,her,lover,but,by,degrees,her,passion,increases,until,she,ceases,to,think,about,her,body,and,then,finally,she,wishes,to,stop,from,further,coition
this,objection,however,does,not,hold,good,for,even,in,ordinary,things,that,revolve,with,great,force,such,as,a,potters,wheel,or,a,top,we,find,that,the,motion,at,first,is,slow,but,by,degrees,it,becomes,very,rapid,in,the,same,way,the,passion,of,the,woman,having,gradually,increased,she,has,a,desire,to,discontinue,coition,when,all,the,semen,has,fallen,away,and,there,is,a,verse,with,regard,to,this,as,follows
the,fall,of,the,semen,of,the,man,takes,place,only,at,the,end,of,coition,while,the,semen,of,the,woman,falls,continually,and,after,the,semen,of,both,has,all,fallen,away,then,they,wish,for,the,discontinuance,of,coition34
lastly,vatsyayana,is,of,opinion,that,the,semen,of,the,female,falls,in,the,same,way,as,that,of,the,male
now,some,may,ask,here,if,men,and,women,are,beings,of,the,same,kind,and,are,engaged,in,bringing,about,the,same,result,why,should,they,have,different,works,to,do
vatsya,says,that,this,is,so,because,the,ways,of,working,as,well,as,the,consciousness,of,pleasure,in,men,and,women,are,different,the,difference,in,the,ways,of,working,by,which,men,are,the,actors,and,women,are,the,persons,acted,upon,is,owing,to,the,nature,of,the,male,and,the,female,otherwise,the,actor,would,be,sometimes,the,person,acted,upon,and,vice,versâ,and,from,this,difference,in,the,ways,of,working,follows,the,difference,in,the,consciousness,of,pleasure,for,a,man,thinks,this,woman,is,united,with,me,and,a,woman,thinks,i,am,united,with,this,man
it,may,be,said,that,if,the,ways,of,working,in,men,and,women,are,different,why,should,not,there,be,a,difference,even,in,the,pleasure,they,feel,and,which,is,the,result,of,those,ways
but,this,objection,is,groundless,for,the,person,acting,and,the,person,acted,upon,being,of,different,kinds,there,is,a,reason,for,the,difference,in,their,ways,of,working,but,there,is,no,reason,for,any,difference,in,the,pleasure,they,feel,because,they,both,naturally,derive,pleasure,from,the,act,they,perform35
on,this,again,some,may,say,that,when,different,persons,are,engaged,in,doing,the,same,work,we,find,that,they,accomplish,the,same,end,or,purpose,while,on,the,contrary,in,the,case,of,men,and,women,we,find,that,each,of,them,accomplishes,his,or,her,own,end,separately,and,this,is,inconsistent,but,this,is,a,mistake,for,we,find,that,sometimes,two,things,are,done,at,the,same,time,as,for,instance,in,the,fighting,of,rams,both,the,rams,receive,the,shock,at,the,same,time,on,their,heads,again,in,throwing,one,wood,apple,against,another,and,also,in,a,fight,or,struggle,of,wrestlers,if,it,be,said,that,in,these,cases,the,things,employed,are,of,the,same,kind,it,is,answered,that,even,in,the,case,of,men,and,women,the,nature,of,the,two,persons,is,the,same,and,as,the,difference,in,their,ways,of,working,arises,from,the,difference,of,their,conformation,only,it,follows,that,men,experience,the,same,kind,of,pleasure,as,women,do
there,is,also,a,verse,on,this,subject,as,follows,men,and,women,being,of,the,same,nature,feel,the,same,kind,of,pleasure,and,therefore,a,man,should,marry,such,a,woman,as,will,love,him,ever,afterwards
the,pleasure,of,men,and,women,being,thus,proved,to,be,of,the,same,kind,it,follows,that,in,regard,to,time,there,are,nine,kinds,of,sexual,intercourse,in,the,same,way,as,there,are,nine,kinds,according,to,the,force,of,passion
there,being,thus,nine,kinds,of,union,with,regard,to,dimensions,force,of,passion,and,time,respectively,by,making,combinations,of,them,innumerable,kinds,of,union,would,be,produced,therefore,in,each,particular,kind,of,sexual,union,men,should,use,such,means,as,they,may,think,suitable,for,the,occasion36
at,the,first,time,of,sexual,union,the,passion,of,the,male,is,intense,and,his,time,is,short,but,in,subsequent,unions,on,the,same,day,the,reverse,of,this,is,the,case,with,the,female,however,it,is,the,contrary,for,at,the,first,time,her,passion,is,weak,and,then,her,time,long,but,on,subsequent,occasions,on,the,same,day,her,passion,is,intense,and,her,time,short,until,her,passion,is,satisfied
,on,the,different,kinds,of,love
men,learned,in,the,humanities,are,of,opinion,that,love,is,of,four,kinds,viz
1,love,acquired,by,continual,habit
2,love,resulting,from,the,imagination
3,love,resulting,from,belief
4,love,resulting,from,the,perception,of,external,objects
1,love,resulting,from,the,constant,and,continual,performance,and,habit,as,for,instance,the,love,of,sexual,intercourse,the,love,of,hunting,the,love,of,drinking,the,love,of,gambling,etc,etc
2,love,which,is,felt,for,things,to,which,we,are,not,habituated,and,which,proceeds,entirely,from,ideas,is,called,love,resulting,from,imagination,as,for,instance,that,love,which,some,men,and,women,and,eunuchs,feel,for,the,auparishtaka,or,mouth,congress,and,that,which,is,felt,by,all,for,such,things,as,embracing,kissing,etc,etc
3,the,love,which,is,mutual,on,both,sides,and,proved,to,be,true,when,each,looks,upon,the,other,as,his,or,her,very,own,such,is,called,love,resulting,from,belief,by,the,learned
4,the,love,resulting,from,the,perception,of,eternal,objects,is,quite,evident,and,wellknown,to,the,world,because,the,pleasure,which,it,affords,is,superior,to,the,pleasure,of,the,other,kinds,of,love,which,exists,only,for,its,sake
what,has,been,said,in,this,chapter,upon,the,subject,of,sexual,union,is,sufficient,for,the,learned,but,for,the,edification,of,the,ignorant,the,same,will,now,be,treated,of,at,length,and,in,detail
